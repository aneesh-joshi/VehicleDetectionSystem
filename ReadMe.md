Here is the code for a system which can track vehicles in a video using Computer Vision.
Primarily, I have used Histogram of Oriented Gradients to seperate cars from non-cars along with a sliding window technique which checks from images.

More details can be found in the ![write up](https://github.com/aneesh-joshi/VehicleDetectionSystem/blob/master/WriteUp.pdf)

The video demonstrating the system can be seen ![here](https://github.com/aneesh-joshi/VehicleDetectionSystem/blob/master/output_video/FinalVideoWithBuffer.mp4)

Here is an example:
